# Nautical Navigation Project – Kaan Aksoy

# Description
  This program is a simple nautical navigation software that the user can use to get nautical information like windspeed, temperature, wave height, locations of boats in the vicinity of a plotted point, and other information that could be acquired from nautical charts.

  The user will import the nautical chart for the desired area, and the corner coordinates of the imported chart. Then the program will overlay weather information, and if desired, other boat activity. The user will be able to plot a deired path, and then the program will give the user the length for the desired route.

# Libraries
  Iris
  Tkinter
  Numpy
  Mathplotlib
  Requests
  Turtle

# User Interface
  The puser wil be able to communicate with the program using window that has the map, with data and course pltted on it, a l   left-side bar that will let the user see other data such as tempreture and length of the plotted course, and a right-side bar that will have buttons for the user to click in order to change the view of the map, such as importing boat locations

# Set of Features
  The program will be able to import and display charts, weather data and data from other boats by the first mile stone and the user will be able to plot a course and get information about the course’s vicinity by the second milestone
